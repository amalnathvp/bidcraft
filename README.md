An **Online Auction System** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** that allows users to create auctions, upload images, and bid on products in real-time. Features include a comprehensive **Admin Dashboard** for managing auctions and users, secure authentication, and real-time device tracking.

> ðŸŽ“ **Major project / Minor project** for Computer Science Engineering â€“ built by **Avnish Kumar** for full-stack learning and portfolio development.

This system supports secure login via **httpOnly cookies**, tracks device & location on login, role-based access control with admin privileges, and is structured with clean code using modern tools like **Redux Toolkit**, **React Router v7**, and **Cloudinary**.
