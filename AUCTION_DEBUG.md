# Auction Creation Debug Guide

## Current Status
✅ Server is running on port 3000
✅ MongoDB connection is working
⚠️ Cloudinary is not configured (image uploads disabled)
✅ Authentication middleware is properly set up
✅ Enhanced error handling is in place

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Error 500 - Server Error
**Possible Causes:**
- Missing required fields in the form
- Invalid date formats
- Authentication issues
- Database connection problems

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Check server logs for specific error details
3. Verify all required fields are filled
4. Ensure user is logged in

### 2. Image Upload Issues
**Current Status:** Cloudinary is not configured, so images cannot be uploaded.

**Solutions:**
- Auction creation will work without images
- To enable images: Configure Cloudinary credentials in server/.env
- Get credentials from https://cloudinary.com

### 3. Authentication Issues
**Check:**
- User must be logged in to create auctions
- Check if auth token exists in browser cookies
- Verify JWT_SECRET is configured in server/.env

### 4. Date Validation
**Requirements:**
- End date must be after start date
- Dates should be in valid format
